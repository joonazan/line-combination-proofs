These lines define the problem
ACE ACE
BCF BCF
DEF DEF

But these are also maximal
CEF CEF
CE ACEF
CF BCEF
EF CDEF
C ABCEF
E ACDEF
F BCDEF

At least in this case, any line can be created by combining two lines.
From one side you take the intersection of the sets and from the other side you take the union.
